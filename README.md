# 2021_personal_site
A multi-page, responsive personal website inspired by 2020's most anticipated game: Cyberpunk 2077.
The website was designed in Adobe XD and developed using HTML and CSS.
The site features a landing page with animated headers and buttons, an 'About Me' page
that gives a brief introduction of myself and displays my proficiences in a card format,
and lastly, a 'Projects' page to showcase my recent projects that are displayed in a card-like
style.
